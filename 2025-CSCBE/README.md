#  CSCBE 2025 — My Challenge Writeups

I participated in the [Cyber Security Challenge Belgium 2025](https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.be/) on March 14–15.  
Among over 1,000 participants, **I reached the finals with my team**. The event took place at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels.

This repo contains writeups for some of the challenges I personally solved.  
I learned a lot throughout the competition — and I’m still learning.
